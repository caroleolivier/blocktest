# Block Test

Thank you very much for letting me working on that test.
I had fun doing it, I did my best in the given time, I hope it makes sense!

Please find below a couple of notes.


### How I spent my time

I spent 4 hours on the test and then play with it for about 20/30 minutes (I was over 4 hours when I wrote this note and committed the last 2 commits).

**3 hours**

I spent the first 3 hours writing the algo, writing a couple of unit tests and moving classes around to make it readable.
I understood what I needed to do quickly but implementing it and making sure it was readable took me some time.

**1 hour**

I spent the last hour (I took a break inbetween) converting the app to React.


### Some of the things I didn't do and wish I had had time to do

* move to TypeScript
* add more unit tests using Jest
* dig into the things I don't know (I have never used gulp for instance)
* my code probably isn't arranged in a very React way (everything is in the same folder right now). I probably would need to move things around
* have somebody taking a look!
